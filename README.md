- 👋Hey there! I'm Guilherme, a curious learner and aspiring tech professional. I love exploring the endless possibilities that technology offers and finding ways to solve real-world problems creatively.
- 👀 I'm fascinated by everything that makes the digital world work—whether it’s coding elegant applications, understanding how systems communicate, or diving into the security aspects that keep us all safe online. Beyond tech, I’m also intrigued by design, teamwork, and how different fields connect to create meaningful solutions.
- 🌱 Right now, I’m diving deeper into web development with Java and React, enhancing my Git skills, and exploring the exciting world of cybersecurity. I also enjoy experimenting with personal projects to sharpen my skills.
- 💞️ I’m eager to join forces on projects that challenge my skills, whether it’s building web applications, contributing to open-source, or brainstorming innovative ideas that make a difference.
