# Guilherme Costa Proença

Aspiring full-stack developer with a strong focus on building modern, scalable, and meaningful digital solutions. I believe technology is not just about code — it’s about solving real problems with creativity, empathy, and precision.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

Currently diving deeper into **React**, **Java Web**, and modern Git workflows, while also expanding my knowledge in **cybersecurity**. I enjoy creating clean UIs, architecting solid backends, and exploring how systems integrate and communicate securely.

Outside of tech, I’m passionate about **design thinking**, **team collaboration**, and everything that brings structure and beauty to digital experiences.

## 🚧 What I’m Working On

- React-based professional templates
- Java Web projects (Spring and raw Servlet)
- Clean GitHub workflows (CI/CD, Husky, Commitizen)
- Building my developer brand (guilhermedeveloper.com coming soon)
- Researching cybersecurity tools and best practices

## 🤝 Let’s Collaborate

I'm open to collaborating on:
- Front-end or full-stack web applications
- Open-source projects with clear structure and purpose
- Tools or automations that improve developer workflows
- Any challenge that pushes boundaries
